## Description

This project uses a range of neural network architectures to classify the **MNIST handwritten digit** and **MNIST fashion** datasets, acting as a comprehensive comparison of different approaches with informative data visualizations. Included is a **hand-coded single perceptron model**, **multi-layer perceptron** architecture, **convolutional neural network** as well as a **multi-task learning CNN model** used on the fashion MNIST dataset.

`project_notebook.ipynb` works through each implementation sequentially using the following python files:

1. `pca.py`
2. `perceptron.py`
3. `mlp.py`
4. `cnn.py`
5. `visualizing_cnn.py`
6. `multitask_learning.py`

All code uses standard python files as well as tensorflow for neural network architectures.

`Report.pdf` is a comprhensive explanation of the methods used and an analysis of the results.
